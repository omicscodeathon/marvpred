Machine Learning Prediction of Potential Inhibitors of the Marburg Virus Gene 4 Small ORF Protein using MARVpred

## Overview
<p align="justify">
  The Marburg virus (MARV), a member of the filovirus family, is a highly virulent pathogen responsible for causing Marburg virus disease (MVD), a hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates. First identified in 1967, MARV has since caused sporadic outbreaks with devastating impacts on human health and socio-economic stability. The disease's primary vector is the Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bat and facilitates its spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, contaminated surfaces, or the consumption of bushmeat. MVD manifests with symptoms such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe hemorrhaging, rapidly progressing to multi-organ failure in many cases. Despite its significant threat, no approved vaccines or antiviral therapies are currently available, making it an urgent target for drug discovery and therapeutic development.
  In this project, we aim to leverage the power of machine learning and molecular docking to accelerate the identification of potential lead compounds against Marburg virus. This approach integrates computational techniques to streamline the traditionally resource-intensive process of drug discovery, offering a rapid, cost-effective alternative to experimental methods.
